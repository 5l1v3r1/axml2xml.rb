This is a pure Ruby library that extracts the XML version of an
AndroidManifest.xml from an Android installer APK package file. To use the script
just pass the path of the APK file as the first argument. The script will build
an XML string that can later be parsed or formatted for viewing.

This script is a direct port of the Java method from [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2097813/how-to-parse-the-androidmanifest-xml-file-inside-an-apk-package)
that performs the same task.
